### About me:
Current student and future graduate of RS-School in the direction of front-end developer.  
I came here to gain relevant knowledge in this area, I want to solve tasks that just recently seemed like magic to me.  
I have never studied programming, although I had experience working in a company that develops applications in virtual and augmented reality (the managers liked the fact that I did not know a single programming language and already made applications). Until then, I was the head of the marketing department in a company that produces reagents for other laboratories. The tasks performed at that place of work did not arouse my interest. And I decided to start (or rather continue) my path in IT.  
In IT sphere the results of my work depend only on my efforts, there are a great many areas for the development of skills.  
I love to cope with tasks that others find overwhelming. I love it when the results of your labors are visible and tangible - it brings pleasure and the desire to continue these labors.
